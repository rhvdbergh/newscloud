    p.text-white This app compares news headlines and summaries of regular news headlines (provided by the awesome 
      a(href='https://newsapi.org') News API
      | ) with Twitter. The app draws word clouds based on the frequency of words found in the same headline, summary or tweet as a specific search term. Data goes back 7 days and is restricted to the latest 100 headlines + summaries and tweets. A news ticker at the bottom of the page shows the 20 most recent searches, as well as theirthe number of times these terms were searched.
